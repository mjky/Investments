# Investments
Course Project C#

Investment application  is an attempt to develop a project to evaluate and review a listed company from specific points of importance.

These evaluations by no means will be a comprehensive one. The application is designed to focus attention on aspects of business which gets buried in comprehensive evaluation. So in some ways these are supplemental evaluations, helpful in major decision making.

At this time the focus in on, "Debt Burden", of a company, which remains a burden till the business starts generating greater returns then cost of servicing corporate debt, and they are eventually paid off. Figures and calculations are hard coded. These will be made live, and dynamic in project upgrade.
